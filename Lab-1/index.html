                    I am from Warangal, India, which is known for its cultural heritage. I am a graduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. My hobbies include reading books and playing chess. I have been here since August 2023, and this is my last semester. I love Chicago for its majestic buildings and rich architecture.

                <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication from Kamala Institute of Technology, India, and I am currently pursuing my Master's in Information Technology and Management at Illinois Tech, specializing in Entrepreneurship. My experience in web development has been progressive, involving hands-on work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React. I have developed small static pages, focusing on responsiveness and basic functionality. I am eager to expand my expertise by learning to implement live pages and build real-time web applications, leveraging technologies such as WebSockets, server-side rendering, and cloud integration to enhance user experiences. My goal is to develop scalable, efficient, and dynamic web solutions that cater to real-world business needs.</p>
