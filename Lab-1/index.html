                    I have developed projects like PawCare, a pet service booking app utilizing Map and Calendar APIs. My expertise includes web application development, CI/CD implementation, and optimizing workflows through AI-driven solutions. I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in building scalable, efficient, and intelligent web applications that enhance business processes.
